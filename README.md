Regression on House Pricing Dataset: Variable Selection & Regularization
We will consider a reduced version of a dataset containing house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

{ Kaggle competition on house prices: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques }

For each house we know 17 house features (e.g., number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc.) plus its price, that is what we would like to predict.
